    <p class="textSection">John's career in the building industry started in New York immediately after he graduated from the Valhalla Technical school for Construction.</p>
    <p class="textSection">After John estabished himself as a small residential renovations contractor in New York, John relocated both family and business to Arizona where he has maintained his corporate headquarters since 1980. In early 1980's work opportunities took John all over the United States, working for hotels/resorts, selective clients, and later in the early 1990's his experience expanded to international projects. Throughout the years, John has taken advantage of booming construction and selective niche markets in which he organized his presence by opening regional offices in Orlando, FL; Atlanta, GA; Houston, TX; Las Vegas, NV; Lihue, HI; Dallas, TX; Zagreb, Croatia; and Podgorica, Montenegro.</p>
    <p class="textSection">In total, John's companies have been directly involved with well over 100 notable hotels/resorts in the US and internationally. Work included renovations of more than 20,000 guest rooms, public spaces, hotel exteriors and major additions to hotel properties as well as ground up construction. John's services include specifically tailored Project Management and Construction Management Programs as well as full scope of General Contractor Services for selective groups of owners and investors.</p>
    <p class="textSection">In the residential sector, John's companies build well over 2,500 single family homes in hawaii for a large home developer as well as for private clients. In Arizona, John's companies have build hundreds of new luxury apartments and homes as well as renovated serveral thousand apartments, which were either upgraded apartments or converted to condominiums. Many single-family homes were also built and renovated throughout Arizona and the US. Construction Management Global has been and will continue to be the exclusive construction and project manager for all spa810's across the United States.</p>
    <p class="textSection">John's ambition is to continue building his business and eventually turn it over to his son, Ivan and his daughters, Doris and Clementine, and other partners, who have participated for many years by working in all geographical areas in various job roles.</p>
    <p class="textSection"> John's philosophy was and continues to be "Be honest, work hard, do good work and clients will come to you," and "Honor your word and your commitments."</p>

    <p class="textSection"><i>Wyatt Whitham, USCG Ret. </i></p>
    <p class="textSection"> Wyatt invites you to review the CMG presentation, he is also excited to hear from you and to move your project forward. </p>
    <p class="textSection">Wyatt in some fashion has been in and around the construction industry throughout his career. Shortly after beginning his construction career, he enlisted in the US Coast Guard. In the CG he served in the Motor life Boat Stations as well as in the aviation fixed wing stations. Although his career was cut short he did retire as distinguished aircrew member (with rescue and surveillance missions all over the world) from Air Station Sacramento CA. One of Wyatt's most prized awards he was given was his Team Accommodation Award. He and his crew earned this through 104 lives saved or rescued and approximately a million dollars of personal and commercial property recovered over a 36 hours period. After retiring he then began working for Honeywell Aerospace. Here he worked as a Electrical Analyst and focused on business processes and improvements. He gained certifications in Six Sigma, Green Belt and DFSS in which his projects, through process reorganizing, had an estimated 2.6 million dollars of savings.</p>
    <p class="textSection">
        Wyatt with his personal drive for growth left the aerospace industry and jumped back into the construction field. He first worked with some of the major home builders in the Phoenix area building thousands of homes. A project Wyatt was honored to be a part of is the on going Phoenix valley rail system. Wyatt's core values have been his drive for continuing education, pride in his work and relationships, professionalism and approach to his work and most of all his leadership through his vast experience. Personally he is a proud husband and father. He and his family enjoy an active life hiking and mountain biking through the trails around their home, spending a day on the lake or taking the family's Dalmatian named "Geronimo" to the dog park.
        A notable personal value he holds close is his area of volunteering. During his period of retiring from the CG he learned of the Disabled American Veterans or "DAV". He worked closely with the officers at that time and has continued through volunteering and donations to be apart of the DAV. He is also nationally and an Arizona State Certified Emergency Medical Technician and has spent time volunteering at local Fire Departments.
